# autoclik
A basic, non-verbose autoclicker using the `pynput` library. To run it, just run the file and press  the \[ followed by the \] key. This key combination will both start and stop the auto clicker.

In the file, you can edit how fast the autoclicker is by changing the sleep time (the default is 0.005), which is measured in seconds.
